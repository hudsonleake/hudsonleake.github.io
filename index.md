## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 7

This was one of my favorite labs that we did. My favorite part was coding in the restrictions on when you are allowed to park. Coding in not just one time restriction, but also 3 restrictions was surprisingly fun.  Figuring out how to code in restrictions for the day of the week, the hours, and the minutes was pretty fun. 

Lab 4 - Part 1

This lab was also one of my favorites, where we had to code in a way to convert units of measurement. This lab was one of the more challenging labs at the time, as many logic errors showed up. But this one of the labs where it felt very rewarding to see everything put together completely.

Lab 6 - Part 2

This lab was also one of my favorites, as I am familiar with blackjack myself. Blackjack is all about getting to as close as 21 as possible, where there is a decent amount of math and chance involved. It was pretty fun coding in the calculations on which value of which card is assigned to each other, and how they are calculated together.
